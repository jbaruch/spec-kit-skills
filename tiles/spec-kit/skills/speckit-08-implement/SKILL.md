# Spec-Kit Implement

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Constitution Loading (REQUIRED)

Before ANY action, load and internalize the project constitution:

1. Read constitution:
   ```bash
   cat .specify/memory/constitution.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_CONSTITUTION"
   ```

2. If file doesn't exist:
   ```
   ERROR: Project constitution not found at .specify/memory/constitution.md

   Cannot proceed without constitution.
   Run: /speckit-00-constitution
   ```

3. Parse all principles, constraints, and governance rules.

4. **Extract Enforcement Rules**: Find all MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, REQUIRED, NON-NEGOTIABLE statements. These rules are checked BEFORE EVERY FILE WRITE.

5. **Hard Gate Declaration**:
   ```
   CONSTITUTION ENFORCEMENT GATE ACTIVE
   Extracted: X enforcement rules
   Mode: STRICT - violations HALT implementation
   ```

## Prerequisites Check

1. Run prerequisites check:
   ```bash
   ../speckit-core/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks
   ```

2. Parse JSON for `FEATURE_DIR` and `AVAILABLE_DOCS`.

3. If error or missing `tasks.md`:
   ```
   ERROR: tasks.md not found in feature directory.
   Run: /speckit-06-tasks
   ```

## Pre-Implementation Validation

**BEFORE any implementation, perform complete validation sweep:**

### Artifact Completeness Check

| Artifact | Required | Check |
|----------|----------|-------|
| constitution.md | YES | Has principles section |
| spec.md | YES | Has Requirements + Success Criteria |
| plan.md | YES | Has Technical Context defined |
| tasks.md | YES | Has at least one task |
| checklists/*.md | YES | At least one checklist |

### Cross-Artifact Consistency

1. **Spec → Tasks**: Every FR-XXX should have corresponding task(s)
2. **Plan → Tasks**: Tech stack should match task file paths
3. **Constitution → Plan**: Verify no constitution violations

### Readiness Score

Report: Artifacts complete, Spec coverage %, Plan alignment, Constitution compliance, Checklist status, Dependencies valid. Output READY or BLOCKED.

## Checklist Gating (CRITICAL)

1. Read each checklist file in `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/`
2. Count: Incomplete (`- [ ]`) vs Complete (`- [x]`)
3. **PASS**: All checklists 100% → proceed
4. **FAIL**: Ask user to proceed or halt

## Execution Flow

### 1. Load Implementation Context

- **REQUIRED**: `tasks.md`, `plan.md`
- **IF EXISTS**: `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `research.md`, `quickstart.md`, `tests/test-specs.md`

### 2. TDD Support Check

If `tests/test-specs.md` exists, perform assertion integrity verification:

**Step 1: Run comprehensive integrity check**
```bash
../speckit-core/scripts/bash/testify-tdd.sh comprehensive-check \
    "FEATURE_DIR/tests/test-specs.md" \
    ".specify/context.json" \
    ".specify/memory/constitution.md"
```

**Step 2: Parse the JSON response**
```json
{
    "overall_status": "PASS|BLOCKED|WARN",
    "block_reason": "...",
    "tdd_determination": "mandatory|optional|forbidden",
    "checks": {
        "context_hash": "valid|invalid|missing",
        "git_note": "valid|invalid|missing",
        "git_diff": "clean|modified|untracked"
    }
}
```

**Step 3: Act on results**

| overall_status | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| `PASS` | Proceed with implementation |
| `BLOCKED` | **HALT** - Display block_reason, require remediation |
| `WARN` | Display warning, proceed with caution |

**BLOCKED remediation:**
```
ASSERTION INTEGRITY CHECK FAILED

Status: BLOCKED
Reason: [block_reason from JSON]

The test assertions have been modified since testify ran.
This violates TDD principles - tests define expected behavior BEFORE implementation.

Remediation options:
1. Revert assertion changes: git checkout -- FEATURE_DIR/tests/test-specs.md
2. Re-run testify to regenerate test-specs: /speckit-05-testify
3. If legitimate spec changes occurred, update spec.md first, then re-run testify

Cannot proceed until assertion integrity is restored.
```

**Display circular verification warning:**
```
⚠️  TDD INTEGRITY ACTIVE

Test assertions are locked. During implementation:
- Fix CODE to pass tests, never modify assertions
- If a test seems wrong, re-run /speckit-05-testify from updated spec
- Assertion tampering will block future implementation runs
```

If TDD is **mandatory** in constitution but test-specs.md missing → ERROR:
```
ERROR: TDD is MANDATORY per constitution but tests/test-specs.md not found.

Run: /speckit-05-testify

Cannot proceed without test specifications.
```

### 2.1 Test Execution Enforcement (CRITICAL)

**Tests MUST be run, not just written.** Writing tests without executing them defeats TDD.

**Mandatory rules:**
1. **After writing any test file**: Run the test immediately to verify it fails (red phase)
2. **After implementing code**: Run tests again to verify they pass (green phase)
3. **Before marking ANY test-related task complete**: Tests MUST have been executed with visible output
4. **"Run test suite" tasks**: Execute ALL tests (unit, integration, e2e) and verify pass/fail status

**What counts as "tests run":**
- Actual execution output showing test results (PASS/FAIL counts)
- NOT just "tests written" or "test file created"
- NOT assuming tests pass without running them

**Blocking conditions:**
- Cannot mark implementation complete if tests haven't been run
- Cannot mark "run tests" task as `[x]` without actual execution output
- If any tests fail, fix code (not tests) before proceeding

**Test execution commands by stack:**
| Stack | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Node/TypeScript | `npm test` or `npx vitest` or `npx jest` |
| Python | `pytest` or `python -m pytest` |
| Go | `go test ./...` |
| Rust | `cargo test` |
| E2E (Playwright) | `npx playwright test` |
| E2E (Cypress) | `npx cypress run` |

**Deterministic verification (REQUIRED):**

After running tests, verify execution with:
```bash
../speckit-core/scripts/bash/verify-test-execution.sh verify \
    "FEATURE_DIR/tests/test-specs.md" \
    "$(cat test-output.log)"
```

The script returns JSON with status:
- `PASS` - All tests ran and passed
- `TESTS_FAILING` - Tests ran but some failed → fix code
- `INCOMPLETE` - Fewer tests ran than expected in test-specs.md
- `NO_TESTS_RUN` - Could not detect test execution → tests weren't run

**Block on any status other than `PASS`.**

### 3. Tessl Integration

If Tessl installed, use tiles for library documentation. See [tessl-integration.md](references/tessl-integration.md) for detailed patterns.

**Key rule**: Before implementing code using a tile's library, query `mcp__tessl__query_library_docs`.

### 4. Project Setup

**Scaffolding in existing directories**: When using project scaffolding tools (e.g., `create-next-app`, `create-vite`, `cargo init`, `go mod init`) in a directory with existing spec-kit artifacts, use force/overwrite flags to prevent conflicts:
- `npx create-next-app . --force`
- `npm create vite . -- --force`
- `cargo init --name project` (works in non-empty dirs)

The spec-kit files (`.specify/`, `.claude/`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) won't be overwritten by these tools.

Create/verify ignore files based on tech stack. See [ignore-patterns.md](references/ignore-patterns.md) for patterns by technology.

### 5. Parse and Execute Tasks

Extract from tasks.md:
- Task phases, dependencies, parallel markers [P]
- Execute phase-by-phase, respecting dependencies
- Parallel tasks [P] can run together

**Execution rules**:
- Query Tessl tiles before implementing library code
- Tests before code if TDD
- **Run tests after writing them** - verify red/green cycle
- **Never mark test tasks complete without execution output**
- Mark completed tasks as `[x]` only after verification

### 6. Output Validation (REQUIRED)

Before writing ANY file:
1. Review against EACH constitutional principle
2. If violation: STOP, explain, suggest alternative
3. If compliant: proceed

### 7. Progress Tracking

- Report after each task
- Halt on non-parallel task failure
- Mark completed tasks `[x]` in tasks.md

### 8. Completion

**Pre-completion checklist:**
- [ ] All tasks marked `[x]` in tasks.md
- [ ] Features validated against spec requirements
- [ ] **ALL tests executed** (not just written) with passing results
- [ ] Test output shown/logged as evidence
- [ ] Report Tessl tile usage if applicable

**CANNOT declare completion if:**
- Tests exist but were never run
- Test execution shows failures
- "Run test suite" task marked complete without actual execution

## Error Handling

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Tasks file missing | STOP: Run /speckit-06-tasks |
| Plan file missing | STOP: Run /speckit-03-plan |
| Constitution violation | STOP, explain, suggest alternative |
| Checklist incomplete | Ask user, STOP if declined |
| Task fails | Report error, halt sequential |
| Tests written but not run | STOP: Execute tests before marking complete |
| Tests failing | STOP: Fix code (not tests), re-run until green |

## Next Steps

```
Implementation complete! Next steps:
- Run tests to verify functionality
- Commit and push changes
- /speckit-09-taskstoissues - (Optional) Export tasks to GitHub Issues
```
