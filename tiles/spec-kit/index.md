# Spec-Kit Skills

A complete 10-phase specification-driven development workflow for AI coding assistants.

## Overview

Spec-Kit provides skills that guide AI assistants through a structured development process, from defining project governance to implementing features and exporting tasks to GitHub Issues.

## Workflow Phases

| Phase | Skill | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Utility | `/speckit-core` | Initialize project, check status, show help |
| 0 | `/speckit-00-constitution` | Define project governance principles |
| 1 | `/speckit-01-specify` | Create feature specification from natural language |
| 2 | `/speckit-02-clarify` | Resolve ambiguities (max 5 questions) |
| 3 | `/speckit-03-plan` | Create technical implementation plan |
| 4 | `/speckit-04-checklist` | Generate quality checklists for requirements |
| 5 | `/speckit-05-testify` | Generate test specifications (TDD support) |
| 6 | `/speckit-06-tasks` | Generate task breakdown |
| 7 | `/speckit-07-analyze` | Validate cross-artifact consistency |
| 8 | `/speckit-08-implement` | Execute implementation |
| 9 | `/speckit-09-taskstoissues` | Export tasks to GitHub Issues |

## Key Features

- **Phase Separation**: Strict boundaries between governance, requirements, and implementation
- **Constitution Enforcement**: All skills validate against project principles
- **TDD Support**: Generate test specs before implementation with tamper detection
- **Checklist Gating**: "Unit tests for English" validate requirements quality
- **Self-Validating**: Each skill checks its own prerequisites
- **Cross-Platform**: Bash and PowerShell support

## Quick Start

1. **Create a constitution** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   /speckit-00-constitution
   ```

2. **Specify a feature**:
   ```
   /speckit-01-specify Add user authentication with OAuth2 support
   ```

3. **Follow the workflow** through plan, tasks, and implementation.
